LISA is a Linux test automation framework with built-in test cases to verify the
quality of Linux distributions on multiple platforms (such as Azure, Hyper-V,
and bare metal). It is an opinionated collection of custom [Pytest][] plugins,
configurations, and tests. See the [design document](DESIGN.md) for details.

[Pytest]: https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/

## Getting Started:

### Install Python 3:

Install Python 3.7 or newer from your Linux distribution’s package repositories,
or [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

### Install Poetry:

[Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) is our preferred tool for Python
dependency management and packaging. We’ll use it to automatically setup a
‘virtualenv’ and install everything we need.

#### On Linux (or WSL):

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-poetry/poetry/master/get-poetry.py | python -
source $HOME/.poetry/env
```

If you are using WSL, installing Poetry on both Windows and Linux may cause both
platforms’ versions of Poetry to be on your path, as Windows binaries are mapped
into WSL’s `PATH`. This means that the Linux `poetry` binary _must_ appear in
your `PATH` before the Windows version, or this error will appear:

```
`/usr/bin/env: ‘python\r’: No such file or directory`
```

Adjust your `PATH` appropriately to fix it.

#### On Windows (in PowerShell):

```powershell
(Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-poetry/poetry/master/get-poetry.py -UseBasicParsing).Content | python -
$env:PATH += ";$env:USERPROFILE\.poetry\bin"
```

### Clone LISA and `cd` into the Git repo:

```bash
git clone -b main https://github.com/microsoft/lisa.git
cd lisa
```

### Install Python dependencies:

```bash
# Install the Python packages
poetry install

# Enter the virtual environment
poetry shell
```

### Use LISA:

```bash
# Run some self-tests
lisa --playbook=playbooks/test.yml selftests/

# Run a demo which deploys Azure resources
lisa --playbook=playbooks/smoke.yaml
```

#### Enable Azure:

To run the demo you’ll need the [Azure CLI][] tool installed and configured:

[Azure CLI]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/

```bash
# Install Azure CLI, make sure `az` is in your `PATH`
curl -sL https://aka.ms/InstallAzureCLIDeb | sudo bash

# Login and set subscription
az login
az account set -s <your subscription ID>
```
