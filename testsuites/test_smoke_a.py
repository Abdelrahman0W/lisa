"""Check that an Azure Linux VM can be deployed and is responsive.

This example uses multiple tests with a module-scoped target fixture.
It's a more Pythonic approach, and since Pytest automatically groups
tests by fixture scopes, these run for each parameter of the target in
order as we would expect. This results in the "smoke test" actually
being a module of multiple unit tests. Another similar alternative is
to use a class and the class-scoped target fixture. See
`test_smoke_b.py` for the single-test approach.
